## Results from EDA

**Total number of foreign tourists**

![](images/Picture1.png)
There is a noticeable increase in the number of foreign tourists during the summer months, with the highest values recorded in July and August in both 2018 and 2019. 
In March 2020, a sharp decline in tourist numbers can be observed due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The lockdown measures led to a near-total halt in foreign tourism. Although the numbers began to rise again in the summer months, 
they reached only about 25% of the values from the summer of 2019. Towards the end of the year, as COVID-19 infections surged,
 additional accommodation facilities were shut down, which contributed to a further significant drop in the number of foreign tourists.


**Average number of foreign tourists per one establishment**

![](images/Picture2.png)
During the summer months, the average number of tourists per accommodation facility is significantly higher, reaching approximately 20 tourists per establishment. This trend is consistent in both 2018 and 2019. In 2020, however, the summer months were marked by an average number of tourists per facility that was roughly half that of previous years. It is also likely that many accommodation establishments remained closed due to the pandemic or were never reopened.
